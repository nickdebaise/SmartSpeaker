# SmartSpeaker

### About
This project was designed *wayyy* back when I first was learning to program. I am keeping this project in my repos to showcase. Initially, it was designed to integrate with Snips.AI, an open-source, run-on-device NLP service. 

### Project
I built the project on a Raspberry Pi and integrated with Snips.Ai. I trained a voice model to respond to certain queries and receive the intent and certain parameters of a voice command. It was then passed to this module which you can look at.

***Warning*** This is **very** old code that I wrote when I was just learning to program.
